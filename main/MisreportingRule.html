Score Reporting

<p>In addition to the $2 of fixed compensation you will receive, you can earn an extra bonus based on the points you report, with a maximum bonus of $2.</p>

<p><strong>If you report 16 points or less, you will receive no bonus.</strong> For each score above 16, you will earn an extra $0.50.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>You report 16 points, bonus=</strong> $0.50 * (16 - 16) = $0 </li>
    <li><strong>You report 19 points, bonus=</strong> $0.50 * (19 - 16) = $1.5 </li>
</ul>

<p>On the next page, you will be asked to report your score. Please note that the bonus payment is based solely on <b>the score you report, not your actual accuracy</b>. You are free to report any score.</p>

<p>However, there is a possibility that your reported score may be cross-checked by others. If this happens, and your reported number is found to be inaccurate, there is a probability that you will lose all your bonus, yet the fixed payment of $2 will remain unaffected.</p>
