<p>You may choose to report <b>any score</b> you like â€” it does <b>not</b> have to match your actual performance (your actual score was {{player.briefing_correct_amount}}).</p>

<p>For every point <b>you report above {{round_robin_integer}}</b>, you will receive an </b>additional $0.50, up to a maximum bonus of $2</b>.</p>

<p>Please note that the earning is based solely on <b>the score you report</b>.</p>

<p>However, your reported score may be reviewed by others. If your score is flagged as potentially inaccurate, your earnings will be adjusted to reflect your true score.</p>
